This Task was able to be finished after four Iterations, on the first iteration I followed this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I&t=484s, before making my website, which helped helped me absorb a large amount of information to make my website. but on my own personal site, I was unable to create tags like this "about" tag to write my process on, or push my work to github. on the second version I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4, and multiple other websites and short videos to help me understand how to push my work into github. On the third iteration I was unable to make the website link fromthe repo work which I was stuck on for a couple days until my senior in the club,Akshya, was able to help me understand the proper way to make the website, like downloading a submodule and referencing the example site.
